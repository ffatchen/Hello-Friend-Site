title: So many options...Hugo Themes 
weight: 10
---

If you are anything like me making decisions is HARD. This problem is exacerbated when the choices feel endless. When making this website I felt quite overwhelmed scroll through [the Hugo themes](https://themes.gohugo.io/) available. Here are some of the steps I took to come to my decision 

## 1. My individual tastes/preferences 

Everyone is unique! This should not be understated in the decision making process.

## 2. My limitations

For the case of choosing a Hugo theme I knew some options would be more compatible with `blogdown`, so I used this website to help me make my decisions https://portfolio.peter-baumgartner.net/2018/07/19/blogdown-using-themes/. 

## 3. Trial and Error 

This is not the original theme I chose. After proceeding through the last to steps I thought I had found my theme, but after implementation it was not what I was looking for. So I repeated the steps above and found a theme I'm satisfied with.

That being said, that is just one of many decision to be made for this website. I will continue repeating these steps as I make more decisions for my website.
